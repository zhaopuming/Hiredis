# HIREDIS

[Hiredis](https://github.com/antirez/hiredis/) is a minimalistic C client library for the [Redis](http://redis.io/) database.

This repository holds D binding for Hiredis. It conforms with D-Programming-Deimos conventions, and is supposed to be one to one translation to its C code.

I'm also developing a higher level library called [dredis](https://github.com/zhaopuming/dredis) on top of hiredis, which is similar to its Java binding [Jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis).
